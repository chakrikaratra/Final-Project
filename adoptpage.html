<center><h1> Meet Paris </h1>
<p1>This sweetheart of a girl was looking found, starving and alone, searching for food on the streets of San Jose. Now he needs a happy ending in a forever home! He has beautiful blue eyes and he is great with other cats. He's also extremely playful and affectionate, and loves to fetch his stuffed toys. </p1>

<center><h1> Meet Coconut </h1>
<p1>Coconut is most definitely a beautiful, energetic, and happy girl! She is learning just like any puppy; she does do some jumping so we know that if a family with children adopts her, the kids should be 16 or over.   </p1>

<center><h1> Meet Furry Bae </h1>
<p1>Hi! My name is Furry Bae, and the Fat Bunny people rescued me from downtown Los Altos when I was a tiny bunny. I was adopted by a couple, but they lost their home and surrendered me to a local shelter. </p1>
